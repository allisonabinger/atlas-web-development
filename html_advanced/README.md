## Overview
This project explores the fundamentals of HTML elements. The focus is creating a basic web page from a wireframe, understanding markup languages, exploring the DOM, and the purpose of HTML tags, elements, and attributes.

## Languages Covered

## HTML
&nbsp;
### What is HTML?
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It provides the structure for web content, allowing you to define headings, paragraphs, links, images, and many other elements.
&nbsp;

### Elements/Tags
In HTML, elements are the building blocks of the web page, and tags are used to define these elements. Elements consist of an opening `<tag>` and a closing `</tag>`.
&nbsp;

### Attributes
Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are always included in the opening tag and are used to modify the elements behavior or appearance. Attributes consis of a name and value.
&nbsp;

### Purpose of HTML Tags
Every HTML tag serves a specific purpose that contributes to the overall structure and appearance of a web page. This project explores tags such as `<div>`, `<blockquote>`, `<img>`, and `<a>`, and highlights their unique roles in creating a cohesive and (somewhat, I miss you CSS!) visually appealing web page.

### How I used HTML!
The following are examples of some of the tags and elements used in this project.


#### Header
The `<header>` element is used to define a header section, typically containing introductory content or navigation links.

>> `<header>`
>> 	`Welcome to the Site!`
>> `</header>`
&nbsp;

#### Main
The `<main>` element is used to represent the main content of an HTML document. It excludes the content that is repeated across multiple pages, like headers and footers.

> `<main>`
> 		`// main block of website`
> `</main>`
&nbsp;

#### Section
The `<section>` element defines a section in an HTML document. It's typically used to group related content together.

> `<section>`
> 		`// section 1`
> `</section>`
>
> `<section>`
> 		`// section 2`
> `</section>`
&nbsp;

#### div
The `<div>` element is used as a generic container that can be used to group other HTML elements for styling or layout purposes. You'll find that I assigned classes to divs to group them together, which can be used to styling later on.

> `<div>`
> 		`// containerized content`
> `</div>`

> `<div class="video-block">`
> 		`// containerized content relating to videos
> `</div>`
