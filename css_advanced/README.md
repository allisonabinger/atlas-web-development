### What is CSS?
CSS, or cascading style sheets, is a stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual presentation of web pages.

## Key Concepts
In this project, I explored the following concepts in advanced CSS:
&nbsp;

### Selectors
Selectors are patterns that match elements to which a style will be applied. You can utilized and combine selectors using the classes, ids, and  elements.
&nbsp;

### Flexboxes
Flexbox is a powerful layout model that allows items within a container to be dynamically arranged, taking up available space and accommodating different screen sizes.
&nbsp;

### Grid
CSS Grid provides a 2D layout system, which can be utilized for precision, but in this project I did not use it much.

## Responsive Design
This project utilized responsive design with flexboxes to ensure the web page will look visually appealing and function across different devices. However, this web page was not thoroughly tested on different devices.
